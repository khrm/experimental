The Webhooks Extension for Tekton provides allows users to set up Git webhooks that will trigger Tekton PipelineRuns and TaskRuns. An initial implementation will use Knative Eventing but we're closely following the eventing discussion in  [Tekton Pipeline](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) to minimize necessary componentry.

In addition to Tekton/Knative Eventing glue, it includes an extension to the Tekton dashboard.
